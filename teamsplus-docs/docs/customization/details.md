# Adjust Design Details  
Fine-tune specific elements like rounded corners, text sizes, and spacing.

---

## Basic Adjustments  
1. Find the setting you want to change:  
   - **Corner roundness** (e.g., sharp edges vs. rounded buttons)  
   - **Text sizes**  
   - **Spacing** between elements
   - **Font weight** bold vs. light
   - **Line height** space between each line
   - **Font size** how big the text is  
2. Enter a number value (most settings use pixels – like `5px` for 5 pixels)  

> Start with small changes (1-10px) for best results.

## Advanced Shadow Effects  
Add depth with shadows:  
1. Use pre-made examples from [this gallery](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples)  
2. Copy and paste any shadow code into the appropriate field. **Important note**: Make sure to remove `box-shadow: ` from the copied code as this is automatically added during runtime. **Please make sure to only paste box-shadow code in places where you are meant to input code for box-shadows!!** This means any group that begins with `var.--shadow`.

## Font weight
Font weight is measured using an integer number from **100 to 900**. 100 is very light and 900 is bold.

## Measurement Tips  
- Most values use **pixels** (numbers with `px`), like `8px`  
- You can also use percentages (`50%`) or other units if you know them  
- See all measurement options [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.php)  

!!! info
    Stick with pixels unless you're comfortable with other units.
