# Customize Colors  
Change the look of Teams by adjusting colors to match your style.

---

## Basic Color Settings  
1. Open the extension menu  
2. Find the color group name you want to change. Each group changes a part of the Teams web interface. A group name usually begins with `var.` or `class.`.
3. Use the color picker to choose the color. A color picker supports transparency.

!!! note
    Currently no descriptions have been added to any group name. You will have to figure out what each group does to the interface. Group descriptions will be added in the future.

    Your color changes wonâ€™t apply to:
