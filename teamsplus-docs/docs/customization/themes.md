# Themes

Themes do what you would expect: they group colors, fonts, details, Twemoji, and other settings into a single package. Themes also allow you to publish your settings to the store.

!!! bug
    Themes are currently partially broken. Potential issues include:
    
    - Adding another theme (via import or installing from the store) may override an existing theme. **Always keep a backup** of your themes, either on the TeamsPlus website or on your PC.  
    - Themes may not always apply correctly.

!!! note
    When you edit settings by clicking the **Edit Current Settings** button, you are not editing the theme currently in use. Instead, you are editing your current settings, which is likely a copy of the theme you loaded.

## The Store

You can explore themes created by other users on the platform (currently, there may only be a few).  

!!! bug
    Installing a theme may override an existing theme in your browser due to the bug mentioned above.

!!! note
    You must be logged in to star themes.
