# Themes

Themes do what you think they do. They group colors, fonts, details, twemoji, ... into a single group. They also allow you to publish your settings on to the store.

!!! bug
    Themes are currently partially broken. Potential issues include
    
    - When adding another theme (either through exporting or installing themes from the store), it may override an existing theme. For this reason, **please keep a backup of your themes** either on the TeamsPlus website or on your own PC.
    - Themes may not always apply correctly


!!! note
    When you edit settings by clicking the "Edit current settings" button, you are not actually editing the theme that is currently in use. Instead, you are editing your current settings, which is most likely a copy of the theme you loaded.

## The store

You can explore themes created by other users on the platform (probably only one lol).

!!! bug
    Installing a theme might override an existing theme in your browser because of the bug mentionned at the beginning.

You must login to star themes.
