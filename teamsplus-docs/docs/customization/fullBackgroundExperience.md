"Full Background Experience" allows the background image to take up the full screen instead of just the chat or channel window. It also allows all the elements in the app to be transparent and have a filter applied.

## How to enable

Scroll to the bottom of the theme advanced options menu, and set *Full Background Experience* to `true`.

## How to customize

#### Backdrop filter

The *Backdrop Filter* allows you to customize the filter applied for each UI element to the background. Examples include:

- `blur(8px)` blurs the background with an 8px radius gaussian blur
- `invert(100%)` inverts the background by 100%

#### Interface Opacity

The *Interface Opacity* allows you to customize the opacity of the UI. This value goes from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).
