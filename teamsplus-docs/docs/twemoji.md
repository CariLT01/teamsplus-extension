# Twemoji (twitter emoji) set support
By enabling Twemoji support, the extension will attempt to replace all the Teams emojis with Twemoji equivalents. Please note that there may be a slight performance overhead when this is enabled.

Internet connection is required for emojis to load.

> **Note:**
> This feature is currently experimental. Occasional glitches may occur.
